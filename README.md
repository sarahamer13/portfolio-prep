### Your professional pitch: You’ve done a recording, so just write down here how it goes.

My name is Sarah and I have a background in the healthcare field and I served in the U.S.Army as a linguist. I have a passion for building things. While I enjoyed my previous job as a reimbursement counselor in the pharmaceutical industry, I wanted something more creative and fulfilling, therefore; I’m learning about software development.

The ability to build an app or software is phenomenal, and I love the versatility of these skills. I can create websites for small businesses like bakeries or build an educational game for kids or build a software for a company.
Researching to find the right answer was a big part of my previous two jobs, and I intend to apply the same method.I'm excited to use my skills to build amazing things.
