My name is Sarah and I have a background in the healthcare field and I served in the U.S.Army as a linguist. I have a passion for building things. While I enjoyed my previous job as a reimbursement counselor in the pharmaceutical industry, I found my passion in building things, and that's why I'm now learning software development.

The versatility and potential of software development are truly phenomenal, and I am thrilled to be able to use my skills to create websites for small businesses, educational games for children, and software for companies. One of my strongest skills is researching to find the best solution to a problem, which was a big part of my previous jobs. I plan to apply that same method to my software development projects.

I am excited to bring my skills to the table and build amazing things.
